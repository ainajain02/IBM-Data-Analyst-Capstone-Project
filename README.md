# ðŸ“Š IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. The capstone project focuses on applying various data analysis techniques to a real-world dataset, showcasing the skills learned throughout the program, including data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and insights generation. The dataset used in this project is from Stack Overflowâ€™s annual Developer Survey. (Data Source : Job posting, Training portals and Surveys)

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:

* Clean and preprocess a raw dataset.
* Analyze the data to uncover meaningful insights.
* Visualize trends and patterns to communicate findings.
* Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used in this project:

* Python (for data manipulation and analysis)
* Pandas (for data cleaning and preprocessing)
* NumPy (for numerical operations)
* Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
* SQL (for querying and managing datasets)
* Jupyter Notebook (for documenting and presenting the analysis)

 ## Key Steps
* Data Collection: The dataset was imported into a Jupyter Notebook for analysis.
* Data Cleaning: Handled missing data, removed duplicates, and transformed variables where necessary.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the datasetâ€™s structure, relationships, and patterns.
* Data Visualization: Created visualizations to uncover trends, outliers, and key insights.
* Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis, I provided actionable recommendations to address key findings.

## Key Insights

* [Dashboard 1- Current technology usage](https://github.com/ainajain02/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/tree/main/Dashboards)- This analysis reflects a tech landscape dominated by versatile, scalable technologies, with an emphasis on full-stack development, cloud infrastructure, and modern web frameworks.
* [Dashboard 2- Future technology trend](https://github.com/ainajain02/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/tree/main/Dashboards)- This analysis provides a clear view of the evolving tech landscape, emphasizing the growing demand for full-stack development skills, cloud platforms, and a balance between relational and non-relational databases.
* [Dashboard 3- Demographics](https://github.com/ainajain02/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/tree/main/Dashboards)- This demographic data highlights the importance of fostering diversity in gender and geography within the tech industry, as well as supporting a wide range of educational backgrounds.

 ## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to apply the data analysis techniques and tools learned during the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. Through cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data, I was able to derive meaningful insights and make data-driven recommendations.
