# ðŸ“Š IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. The capstone project focuses on applying various data analysis techniques to a real-world dataset, showcasing the skills learned throughout the program, including data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and insights generation. The dataset used in this project is Data Source : Job posting, Training portals and Surveys "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-Skills-Network/LargeData/m2_survey_data.csv"

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:

* Clean and preprocess a raw dataset.
* Analyze the data to uncover meaningful insights.
* Visualize trends and patterns to communicate findings.
* Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used in this project:

* Python (for data manipulation and analysis)
* Pandas (for data cleaning and preprocessing)
* NumPy (for numerical operations)
* Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
* SQL (for querying and managing datasets)
* Jupyter Notebook (for documenting and presenting the analysis)

 ## Key Steps
* Data Collection: The dataset was imported into a Jupyter Notebook for analysis.
* Data Cleaning: Handled missing data, removed duplicates, and transformed variables where necessary.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the datasetâ€™s structure, relationships, and patterns.
* Data Visualization: Created visualizations to uncover trends, outliers, and key insights.
* Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis, I provided actionable recommendations to address key findings.

## Key Insights
* HTML/CSS is estimated to stay popular the same inthe next year
*  PostgreSQL will be the most demand of database
*   Linux platform is predicted to stay the same at 1st requirement
*   The most percentage of Web Frame will be occupied by React.js
*   Men are interested in IT skills more than women

 ## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to apply the data analysis techniques and tools learned during the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. Through cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data, I was able to derive meaningful insights and make data-driven recommendations.
